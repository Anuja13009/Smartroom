# SmartRoom — Full Stack Booking System

SmartRoom is a full-stack web application designed to manage real-time room and time slot bookings across multiple library locations. Built using React, Firebase, MongoDB, and Twilio, it enables users to reserve rooms with ease while reducing no-shows and improving database performance.
